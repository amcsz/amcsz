## Hey there!

I'm a programmer, hacker, and student at TJHSST (Class of 2028).

### Programming Experience
Here are some of my favorite projects I've worked on:
- TJ Computer Team Autograder
  - I created a [new autograder website](https://github.com/TJ-Computer-Team/autograder2) for our school's computer team, written in python + django. The website uses [celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) as a task queue to communicate with the [code running server](https://github.com/TJ-Computer-Team/coderunner) that handles user code submissions, which I wrote in rust.

### Computer Setup
I use Fedora Linux as my main operating system. I use vscode as my primary code editor.
